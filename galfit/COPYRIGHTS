  DISCLAIMERS, USER AGREEMENT AND COPYRIGHTS

    * The reason for this formality is that I have (as most of us have) legal
      bindings to our institutions (for me it's the University of Arizona)
      more than anything else. So here goes....

    * This code -- with the exception of the Numerical Recipes (R) subroutines
      (Press et el. 1997) and the FFT subroutines (fftsg2d.c and fftsg.c),
      which are written by Takuya Ooura -- are copyrighted by Chien Yi Peng.
      Users are free to modify, distribute, use the code, and publish results
      from it without my consent or knowledge, by adhering to the following
      guidelines.

    * There may be other software by the same name (in the past or the
      future). The agreements below obviously apply only to the software
      specifically published in Peng, Ho, Impey, & Rix 2002, AJ, 124: 266, and
      described above, which is provided to the public at large free of
      charge, and without further obligation.

    * Users of this code use it at own risk and should understand this is work
      in progress. There will likely be future updates. I very much welcome
      suggestions on how to improve GALFIT and fix bugs.

    * Users are encouraged, but not required, to e-mail me
      (cyp@as.arizona.edu) to be put on the user list. The e-mail addresses I
      receive will solely be used to contact users when there are important
      updates. I will not redistribute e-mail addresses in any way or use them
      for any other purpose.

    * Users who remotely think there's a bug in GALFIT are urged to contact me
      (cyp@as.arizona.edu). I promise I won't bite.

    * Users are encouraged to check back regularly to download the newest
      version of this code.

    * I issue the source code to users because I don't mind users freely
      modifying GALFIT for *personal use* for purposes I have not thought
      about.  However, code modifiers may not change the program name (except
      the version number to distinguish it as a modified version), and must
      document *the changes* explicitly in all forms of publications using
      this software.

    * Users who modify GALFIT are encouraged to contact me to incorporate
      his/her changes into newer versions for public distribution. But I
      reserve the discretion for making additions.

    * I understand sometimes people (such as co-workers) act as a
      re-distributor of GALFIT, which is just fine. However, for maintaining
      some kind of version control and code uniformity, once a user
      **modifies** GALFIT for personal use, he/she may not redistribute the
      changes for public use (for free or for cost), in any way, shape, or
      form, or under a different software title, without prior explicit
      written consent by me. If there's an important or useful change to the
      program I would like to know about it. There is one exception, ...

    * Issuing a personally modified GALFIT code to a coworker on the same
      project is perfectly o.k.. However, the code must remain inside that
      collaboration, and may not be redistributed publicly.
