# POSTAGE STAMP TEST FOR PYMORPH
#-------------------------------

This directory contains a simple 
test of postage stamp fitting in 
PyMorph. 

The expected results and
all output files are stored in this
directory for the tester to review
and compare.

The test results will appear in the
"results" directory.

The input data is supplied in the 
"data" directory.

The test consists of 8 galaxies that
can be fit by PyMorph using a single
Sersic model.

All configuration files are set...
but the user must adjust the paths
in the files as necessary to correctly
point to the galfit, SExtractor 
installations.

# INSTRUCTIONS TO USER
#---------------------------------

1) Enter the results directory 
   and open config.py  

2) adjust the paths for "datadir",
   "outdir", "GALFIT_PATH", "SEX_PATH",
   and "PYMORPH_PATH" to point to the 
   data directory used for this test, 
   the results director used for this
   test, the galfit installation, the
   SExtractor installation, and the 
   PyMorph installation, respectively

3) Save and close the file. 

4) Run PyMorph in the "results" directory

5) cd up one directory and run the 
   "cmp_results.py" script. This will 
   produce a plot comparing several
   values to the original fitted values.

6) When you are done, run "clean_dir.py" 
   to clean test files from the "results"
   directory.
